# Week 6 - Performance Evaluation and Analysis 

### Testing Methodology:
1. CPU usage
2. Memory usage
3. Disk I/O performance
4. Network performance
5. System latency
6. Service response times.

### Testing Scenarios:
Baseline performance testing
• Application load testing
• Performance analysis identifying bottlenecks
• Optimisation testing. Aim to implement and evidence at least two improvements.

### Deliverables

Document your approach
2. Create a performance data table with structured measurements for all applications and
metrics
3. Create performance visualisations including charts and graphs
4. Capture testing evidence
5. Conduct network performance analysis documenting latency and throughput
6. Capture optimisation analysis results describing improvements with quantitative data
