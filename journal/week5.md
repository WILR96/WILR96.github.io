# Week 5 - Advanced Security and Monitoring Infrastructure 

### Implement Access Control using SELinux or AppArmor, with documentation showing how to track and report on access control settings.

### Configure automatic security updates with evidence of implementation

### Configure fail2ban for enhanced intrusion detection

### Create a security baseline verification script (`security-baseline.sh`) that runs on the server (executed via SSH) and verifies all security configurations from Phases 4 and 5

### Create a remote monitoring script (`monitor-server.sh`) that runs on your workstation, connects via SSH, and collects performance metrics from the server.
